Add `modern` output mode
In this mode the `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, and `lineHeight` core plugins are replaced, adding custom properties to the output of each which are used in the `calc()` expressions in the utility class.

`modern` mode is enabled by default. The previous functionality can be maintained if needed by switching to `classic` mode.
